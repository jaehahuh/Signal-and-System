# Signals-and-Systems

Programming language: MATLAB

These are homework and projects that I did in NYU Tandon signals and systems class.

What I learned in this class is linear system theory for analog and digital systems; linearity, causality and time invariance; impulse response, convolution and stability; the Laplace, z- transforms and applications to Linear Time Invariant (LTI) systems; frequency response, analog and digital filter design; Fourier Series, Fourier Transforms and the sampling theorem
