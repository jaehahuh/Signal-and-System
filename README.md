# Signals-and-Systems

Programming language: MATLAB

These are homework and projects that I did in NYU Tandon signals and systems class. What I learned in class is as follows.

- linear system theory for analog and digital systems
- linearity, causality and time invariance
- impulse response, convolution and stability
- the Laplace, Z- transforms and applications to Linear Time Invariant (LTI) systems
- frequency response, analog and digital filter design
- Fourier Series, Fourier Transforms and the sampling theorem
